title:  "gabby tongue"
author: Reppard Walker

today i found a ghost dress in my old clothes

he was whistling something tongue in cheek

and he wouldn't listen when i tried to speak

i swear i saw him glance over his whiskey drink


thats when i felt a chill like some frozen air

all his demons still my own cross to bare

and i was terrified so i ran away

to save these similes for another rainy day



this hearts just an anchor hung here to weigh me down

this souls is a beggar roaming town to town to town to town

my mind is a twister disordered anarchy

my life's a cautious clown..



see theres no subtlety in false bravery

i bravely lock the door and discard the key

stained glass shattering down around my feet

symbolic christening on an abstract street


see i am now 32 could be a lot like you

still got no answers for all the things i do

i am an animal acting on instinct

like the callous sheep who counts himself to sleep

```
