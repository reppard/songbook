well i suppose old shady better turn the light on

his desert rose just bloomed and withered away

no time for saving dried pedals

no time for debts to repay


and i suppose the ol' lady better leave the light on

theres a ghost who haunts me each and every day

and no time wont make him go away

no time wont make him go away


it's not enough for me to be sorry

i'm about as sorry as they come

though i'd surely die for my family

i give tainted blood as restitution
```
