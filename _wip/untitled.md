got a call from a friend. he asked me “how have you been?”

i told him “fine”, though we both know thats a lie

yeah i've been packing your things playing back everything

in my mind, taking care not to compromise


and it's a shame we can't talk

you've been giving and taking and bending and breaking

for so long that you've lost the will to try


the thing that makes me so mad is i gave all that i had

trying hard not to cast those stones at you

if i could change anything i'd treat you more like a queen

all the dust and the dirt at your feet, i'd worship it





on the inside we're all nervous wrecks

no one told us bads' as good as it gets

remember punk rock on the radio?

we were young and dumb with nowhere to go


we were shadows, we were silhouettes

we were bad ideas false hopes and regrets


and i don't doubt that that when we get home

they're gonna bury our boots with our bones
