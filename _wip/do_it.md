```
a rock may not always be so solid as it seems

the sturdiest stone will sometimes crumble into the sea

a dog ain't alone if he's got atleast just one flea

a man in a cavemine so many miles from being free

life without love is like a lock with out a key

the dirt between us is the only delta between you and me


i've been thinking about how i've been living in doubt

i just caint figure me out, no i can't figure me out

no i can't figure out anything


just go and do it, do it

go on and do what suits you right

go on and do it, do it

whatever suits you for the night
```
