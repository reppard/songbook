title:  "Sweep Me Up"
---
# E, Bm7, A
```
Early Monday morning
I told my love
"Every time I fall to pieces
You're right there to sweep me up"

But pretty eyes
Can only get you by Love
Beauty fades out long before
Your words could ever die

When I fall down
You pick me up
Back on my feet where I belong
When I fall down
You pick me up
You dust me off and keep my fighting on

Sweeter than pure sugar cane
Is my Love
These rotten teeth may fall to pieces
But I could never spit her out

Pure cocaine can't hold a flame
To my Love
Gets the blood in my heart racing
Faster than a train run wild
```
