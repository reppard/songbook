title:  "sweep me up"
author: Reppard Walker

E, Bm7, A

early monday morn' i says to my love

"every time i fall to pieces you come around and sweep me up"

but pretty eyes can only get you by love

beauty fades out long before your words could ever die


when i fall down you pick me up

back on my feet where i belong

when i fall down you pick me up

you dust me off and keep my fighting on


sweeter than pure sugar cane is my love

these rotten teeth may fall to pieces but i could never spit her out

pure cocaine can't hold a flame to my love

gets the blood in my heart racing faster than a train run wild
```
