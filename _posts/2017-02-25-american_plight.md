Verse:  
Summer came back to life  
Born out of dying Spring  
The setting Sun was on the run  
And sank into the sea  

It barely made a splash  
So far as anyone could see  
And held it's breath one-thousand years  
Waiting to be let free  

But it lost... the fight... with the tide  

Verse:  
Then Winter came to shake our hands  
Like long forgotten friends  
His crooked smile  
All frozen on the outside looking in  

The crocodile swallowed the child  
Just as his life had began  
His toothy smile  
A faded yellow army of crimson  

And we've all... lost sight... of the Light  

Chorus:  
Now I don't think I'll  
Be winning the fight  
This new American pride  
This new American plight  

Now I think it's time  
We bury the knife  
This new America
