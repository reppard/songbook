title:  "american plight"
author: Reppard Walker
chords: G(Big), G/F#, C(add7), Em, D, D7


intro: G, G, C, G, G, G/F#, Em, Em, G/F#, G

G
summer came back to life
     C
born out of dying spring
    G
the setting sun was on the run
    C
And sank into the sea
   D
it barely made a splash
          C
so far as anyone could see
    G
and held it's breath one-thousand years
    C
waiting to be let free
       D           C                     G
but it lost... the fight... with the tide

G
then winter came to shake our hands
     C
like long forgotten friends
    G
his crooked grin
                  C
all frozen on the outside looking in
    D
the crocodile swallowed the child
       C
before his life could begin
    G
his toothy smile
               C
a faded yellow army of crimson
          D           C                    G
and we've all... lost sight... of the light


chorus:
  Em                                G
i don't think I can stomach the site
               Am                      D7
a new american plight, a new american plight
  Em                                 G
i don't think i can stomach the fight
                      Am                   D
why don't we bury the knife? a new america plight
```
