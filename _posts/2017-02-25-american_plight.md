G, G, C, G, G, G/F#, Em, Em, G/F#, G

G
Summer came back to life
     C
Born out of dying Spring
    G
The setting Sun was on the run
    C
And sank into the sea
   D
It barely made a splash
          C
So far as anyone could see
    G
And held it's breath one-thousand years
    C
Waiting to be let free
       D           C                     G
But it lost... the fight... with the tide

G
Then Winter came to shake our hands
     C
Like long forgotten friends
    G
His crooked smile
                  C
All frozen on the outside looking in
    D
The crocodile swallowed the child
       C
Before his life could begin
    G
His toothy smile
               C
A faded yellow army of crimson
          D           C                    G
And we've all... lost sight... of the Light


Chorus:
  Em                                G
I don't think I can stomach the site
               Am                      D7
A new American plight, a new American plight
  Em                                 G
I don't think I can stomach the fight
                      Am                   D
Why don't we bury the knife? A new America plight
```
