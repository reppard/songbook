title:  "unholy smoke"
author: Reppard Walker

A7, D, Am, Em

unholy smoke on sacred ground

fire consumes me without a sound

and i don't scream, i just stand around

waiting to turn into ash and float into the sunset


unholy smoke on sacred ground

a fire burns as dreams are turned to emptiness

just like promises


we count the stars every night

but their numbers fade with the coming of the morning light

and thats alright, ain't it?


i'm not known for making promises

cause i could not afford to keep them

but i would die for you...


holy smoke on sacred ground

fire consumes us without a sound

and we all just laugh and dance around

waiting to turn into ash and float into the sunset


i lost hope

and i can't find

her nowhere
