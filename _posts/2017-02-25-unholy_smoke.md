title:  "Unholy Smoke"
---
### A7, D, Bm, Em

Unholy smoke on sacred ground  
Fire consumes me without a sound  
And I don't scream, I just stand around  
Waiting to turn into ash and float into the sunset  

Unholy smoke on sacred ground  
A fire burns as dreams are turned to emptiness  
Just like promises  

We count the stars every night  
But their numbers fade with the coming of the morning light  
And thats alright, ain't it?  

I'm not known for making promises  
Cause I could not afford to keep them  
But I would die for you...  

Holy smoke on sacred ground  
Fire consumes us without a sound  
And we all just laugh and dance around  
Waiting to turn into ash and float into the sunset  
 
I lost hope  
And I can't find  
Her nowhere
