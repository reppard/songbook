G
damn sam, you ain't no ma'am sam
             D          C          D
you ain't no woman as i recall, oh no
            G
you in your red gown, you let your hair down
        D                            C    D
another round, hell, it gets hard to call


Em                                 G
i'll believe anything you want, anything you want at all
Em                                 G
i'll believe anything you want, anything you want at all
Em                                 G
i'll believe anything you want, anything you want at all
	      D
just so long as this old room
          C              D              G
gets some use before the wakeup call at noon


G
damn sam, i let you down.
             D                         C        D
it's not all me i'm backed against the wall, oh lord
         G
cause my wife found your wigs and gold crown
            D                              C        D
whiskey and coke mounds, but god, we had a ball now didn't we?


Em                                 G
she'll believe anything i want, anything i want at all
Em                                 G
she'll believe anything i want, anything i want at all
Em                                 G
she'll believe anything i want, anything i want at all
        D
just so long as you and i
          C                    D             G
keep this hid though this love is so hard to hide
