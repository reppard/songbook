Damn Sam, you ain't no ma'am Sam  
You ain't no woman as I recall  

But in your red gown, you let your hair down  
Another round and it gets hard to call  

I'll believe anything you want  
Any thing you want at all  
Just so long as this old room  
Gets some use before the wakeup call at none  

Damn Sam, I let you down.  It's not all me  
I'm backed against the wall  

My wife found your wigs and gold crown  
Whiskey and coke mounds, we sure had a ball didn't we?  

She'll believe anything I want  
Anything I want at all  
Just so long as you and I  
Keep this hid though this love is so hard to hide
