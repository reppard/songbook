Timing: 3/4
Chords: G(Big), C(add9), D

Intro: G x4

G
Remember those good times?

That you can't ignore

How I kept you laughing

Til your guts were sore
C
Now your dead silent

As I head for the door
  G            D               C        G
I guess I just ain't that damn funny no more

G
Now our share of bad times

Could stack to the roof

As if all these holes

In these walls ain't proof
      C
Sheet rock on my knuckles

Theres glass on the floor
  G            D               C        G
I guess I just ain't that damn funny no more

G x2

      C
Well, use to we'd fight

And we'd make up alright
     G
We'd be back to loving

By the end of the night
      C
You'd call me a dick

And I'd call you a whore
  G            D               C        G
I guess I just ain't that damn funny no more

C, C, G, G
C, C, G, D, C, G
