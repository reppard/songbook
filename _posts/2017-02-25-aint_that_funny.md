title:  "Ain't That Funny"
---
```
Remember those good times?
You can't ignore
How I kept you laughing
While your gut turned sore
Now you sit silent
As I head for the door
I guess I just ain't that damn funny no more

Our share of bad times
Could stack to the roof
And if all these holes
In these walls ain't proof
Sheet rock on my knuckles
And glass on the floor
I guess I just ain't that damn funny no more

Use to we'd fight
But we'd make up all right
We'd be back to loving
By the end of the night
You'd call me a dick
And I'd call you a whore
I guess I just ain't that damn funny no more
```
