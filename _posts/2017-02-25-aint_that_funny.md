timing: 3/4
chords: G(Big), C(add9), D


intro: G x4

G
remember those good times that you can't ignore

how i kept you laughing 'til your guts were sore
C
now your dead silent as i head for the door
  G            D               C        G
i guess i just ain't that damn funny no more

G
now our share of bad times could stack to the roof

as if all these holes in these walls ain't proof
      C
sheet rock on my knuckles theres glass on the floor
  G            D               C        G
i guess i just ain't that damn funny no more

G x2

      C
well, use to we'd fight and we'd make up alright
     G
we'd be back to loving by the end of the night
      C
you'd call me a dick and i'd call you a whore
  G            D               C        G
i guess i just ain't that damn funny no more

C, C, G, G
C, C, G, D, C, G
