title:  "puddles"
author: Reppard Walker

rest assured i'm okay walking circles in the rain

there's some dogs in the street lapping puddles in the rain

hey i've got shows on my feet, who am i to complain?

just rest assured i'll be okay walking circles in the rain


but if i'm truly being honest, i never kept a single promise

no, and i cannot recall the last time i felt so free



i wanna change my name and if it's all the same

i'm gonna ditch this town when the sun goes down

and i'll burn in hell for the sins i sell

i'm gonna fall in love, no, never giving up


so tie a kite around my feet, think i was born to float away

i hear the waves start to break leaving my regrets in their wake

and all these people in the streets are constantly getting in my way

so tie a kite around my feet, think i was born to float away


and as i'm pulled into the clouds, can't help but smile

as the world spins round and round and i can't recall the last time

i felt so high
