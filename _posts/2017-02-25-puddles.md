author: Reppard Walker

rest assure that i'm okay walking circles in the rain

there's a dog in the street lapping puddles in the rain

and i've got shows on my feet, who am i to complain?

just rest assure that i'm okay walking circles in the rain


i view my world through fractured lenses

kaleidoscopic and pretended

i need a plot line with a twist...


a little change might do me good.  yeah some change could do me good.

if things don't turn out like they should, i wouldn't change them if i could.

a little change might do me good.


so tie a kite around my feet, i think i was born to float away

i hear the waves about to break just leaving my regrets in their wake

and all these people in the streets are constantly getting in my way

so tie a kite around my feet, i think i was born to float away
