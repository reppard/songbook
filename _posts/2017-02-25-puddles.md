```
Rest assure that I'm okay walking circles in the rain

There's a dog in the street lapping puddles in the rain

And I've got shows on my feet, who am I to complain?

Just rest assure that I'm okay walking circles in the rain


I view my world through fractured lenses

Kaleidoscopic and pretended

I need a plot line with a twist...


A little change might do me good.  Yeah some change could do me good.

If things don't turn out like they should, I wouldn't change them if I could.

A little change might do me good.


So tie a kite around my feet, i think i was born to float away

I hear the waves about to break just leaving my regrets in their wake

And all these people in the streets are constantly getting in my way

So tie a kite around my feet, i think i was born to float away
