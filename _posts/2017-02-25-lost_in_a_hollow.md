title:  "Lost In a Hollow"
---
```
I searched a valley for a peaceful spring
The grass was green and all the birds were singing
For a moment so brief I thought that I could breath
And I got caught up in the moment
Like a river I was running free
The taste of life was what I really wanted

Well I searched all day and oh what did I find?
When the sun burns out, oh how it makes you blind
Shadows made nightmares from my day dreams
Creatures prepared to seize the moment
The wolves could smell me, they could hear me breath
To taste my life was what they really wanted

When I get lost in a hollow
The way out ain't always so easy to find
It's always cold sweats and regrets that follow
When I get lost in a hollow

The dawn came on just like a rolling tide
And my brain in pain told me I hadn't died
I stood myself up to dust off my blue jeans
Filthy to clean in just a moment
A rocky path had crawled beneath my feet
To lead me where I really wanted
```
