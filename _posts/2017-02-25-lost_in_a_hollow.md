title:  "lost in a hollow"
author: Reppard Walker

i searched a valley for a peaceful spring

the grass was green and all the birds were singing

for a moment so brief i thought that i could breath

and i got caught up in the moment

like a river i was running free

the taste of life was what i really wanted


well i searched all day and oh what did i find?

when the sun burns out, oh how it makes you blind

shadows made nightmares from my day dreams

creatures prepared to seize the moment

the wolves could smell me, they could hear me breath

to taste my life was what they really wanted


when i get lost in a hollow

the way out ain't always so easy to find

it's always cold sweats and regrets that follow

when i get lost in a hollow


the dawn came on just like a rolling tide

and my brain in pain told me i hadn't died

i stood myself up to dust off my blue jeans

filthy to clean in just a moment

a rocky path had crawled beneath my feet

to lead me where i really wanted
