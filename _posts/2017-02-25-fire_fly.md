## G, Am, D, C, G

I met at little blue eyed firefly  
From Alabam  
Bare foot as a grizzly bear  
Drinking warm sweet tea  
In her underwear  

On the back porch  
Her camel lights  
Were all in line  
To kiss the lips  
That keep on calling mine

An angel raised on honky tonk  
Thats what she claims to be  
But those precious little shoulder blades  
They don't look like wings to me

I don't think those pretty eyes  
Have seen the harder side  
Of heart ache they call honky tonk, no
