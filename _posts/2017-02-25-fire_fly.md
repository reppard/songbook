G                                      Am
i met at little blue-eyed firefly from suwanee dam
D7                                   G
bare foot as a grizzly bear drinking warm sweet tea in her underwear
                                 A
on the back porch her camels are all in line
   C                  D               G
to kiss the lips that keep on calling mine

G
an angel raised on honky tonk, thats what she claims to be
          Am                             C
but those darling little shoulder blades sure don't look like wings to me
G
i don't think those pretty eyes have seen the harder side
   Am                                 C
of heart ache they call honky tonk, no
