author: Reppard Walker
chords: D, F#, Bm, G, Gm, A

D                             F#
people say that i'm losing my mind
    Bm                      G                      A                D
but i know it ain't me this old damn world is just spinning to slow
                             F#
yeah, i think i'm doing just fine
   Bm               G               A           F#
if mona could see me she'd probably turn up her nose

       Gm          D     F#
no she wont listen to me
                    Gm        D     F#
why does her memory rot in my soul?
             Gm          D     A
the darkness wont listen to me

if i had half a mind
                          D
i'd probably blow it away

                       F#
i think i done lost my mind
    Bm                     G                 A                D
somewhere between here and mushrooms down in strawberry grove
                             F#
to get it back it just might take a little time
     Bm                     G                    A            F#
some big laughing bird just flew by, snatched it right out my nose

        Gm         D        F#
now his madness consumes me
                  Gm         D     F#
why does his song sing in my soul?
             Gm           D     A
the darkness don't listen to me

i use to have a mind
                        D
but then i blew it away


i think i done lost my mind
