title:  "i'm losing my mind"
author: Reppard Walker

D, Bm, G, A

people say that i'm losing my mind

but i know it ain't me this old damn world is just spinning to slow

yeah, i think i'm doing fine

if mona could see me she'd probably turn up her nose


no she wont listen to me

why does her memory rot in my soul?

the darkness don't listen to me

if i had half a mind

i'd probably blow it away


i think i done lost my mind

somewhere between here and mushrooms down in strawberry grove

to get it back it just might take a little time

some big laughing bird just flew by, snatched it right out my nose


now his madness consumes me

why does his song sing in my soul?

the darkness don't listen to me

i use to have a mind

but then i blew it away

i think i done lost my mind
```
