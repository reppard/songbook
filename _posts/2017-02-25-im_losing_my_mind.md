title:  "I'm Losing My Mind"
---
### D, Bm, G, A

People say that I'm losing my mind  
But I know it ain't me  
This old damn world is just spinning to slow  

Yeah, I think I'm doing fine  
If Mona could see me  
She'd probably turn up her nose  

No she wont listen to me  
Why does her memory rot in my soul?  
The darkness don't listen to me  
If I had half a mind  
I'd probably blow it away  

I think I done lost my mind  
Somewhere between here  
And mushrooms down in Strawberry Grove  

To get it back it just might take a little time  
Some big laughing bird  
Just flew by, snatched it right out my nose  

Now his madness consumes me  
Why does his song sing in my soul?  
The darkness don't listen to me  
I use to have a mind  
But then I blew it away  

I think I done lost my mind
