title:  "All Damn Night"
---
```
We'll take a trip where souls eclipse us
We wont need a boarding pass
If true love is what you're out to get
It isn't love if you've gotta ask

I know just what you've been waiting for
Something pure and spiritual

We'll dance just like you wanted to
How about on the couch?
Move it to the floor
We've got all damn night and tomorrow too
We'll hit every room
'til our knees get sore
Oh I swear you move like light
Lets just take our time
Cause we've got all damn night

You can't run from your addictions
An instinct makes sure of that
Carnal pulse dictates your actions
Don't you find it funny that

Those night lights get your paranoid
When the rhythm stops you feel a void
I know just what you've been waiting for
Something pure and spiritual
```
