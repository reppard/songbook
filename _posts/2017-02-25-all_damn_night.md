Dm7                     Bb
Let's take a trip where souls eclipse us
                 A
We don't need no boarding pass
Dm7                    Bb
If it's love that your out to get girl
                        A
It ain't love if you've gotta ask


        Dm7    C                     Bb          C
And oh, I know just what you've been waiting for
Dm7       C        Bb        C
Something pure and spiritual


F
Well alright...
F     G          Am   C   Bb
We'll dance just like you wanted to
          C                     F
How about on the couch? Move it to the floor
       F   G    Am     C Bb
We got all damn night, tomorrow too
          C                   F
We'll hit every room 'til our knees get sore
     Dm7                 Bb
Oh I swear you move like light
                        C
We're just taking our time

Cause we got all damn night
Dm7

Dm7, C Bb, A, Bb


Dm7                Bb
You can't run from your addictions
                  A
An instinct makes sure of that
Dm7             Bb
Carnal pulse dictates your actions
                  A
Don't you find it funny that


      Dm7          C        Bb       C
Those night lights get your paranoid
         Dm7    C         Bb          C
When the rhythm stops you feel a void
        Dm7    C                     Bb          C
And oh, I know just what you've been waiting for
Dm7       C        Bb        C
Something pure and spiritual
