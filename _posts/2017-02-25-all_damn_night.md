intro: Dm7, C Bb, A, Bb

Dm7                     Bb
let's take a trip where souls eclipse us
                 A
we don't need no boarding pass
Dm7                    Bb
if it's love that your out to get girl
                        A
it ain't love if you've gotta ask


        Dm7    C                     Bb          C
and oh, i know just what you've been waiting for
Dm7       C        Bb        C
something pure and spiritual


F
well alright...
F     G          Am   C   Bb
we'll dance just like you wanted to
          C                     F
how about on the couch? move it to the floor
       F   G    Am     C Bb
we got all damn night, tomorrow too
          C                   F
we'll hit every room 'til our knees get sore
     Dm7                 Bb
oh i swear you move like light
                        C
we're just taking our time

cause we got all damn night
Dm7

Dm7, C Bb, A, Bb


Dm7                Bb
you can't run from your addictions
                  A
an instinct makes sure of that
Dm7             Bb
carnal pulse dictates your actions
                  A
don't you find it funny that


      Dm7          C        Bb       C
those night lights get your paranoid
         Dm7    C         Bb          C
when the rhythm stops you feel a void
        Dm7    C                     Bb          C
and oh, i know just what you've been waiting for
Dm7       C        Bb        C
something pure and spiritual
