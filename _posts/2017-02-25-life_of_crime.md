title:  "life of crime(duet)"
author: Reppard Walker

guy:

crime, it pays sometimes but nickles and dimes

dont get me very close to you

thats well and fine, i'll fry my mind

all day long 'cause i ain't got shit else to do

chorus:

and baby, there ain't no question

if this is right or wrong

the only question is for how far and how long

i'll drag these heels of mine

through this dirt and shit that i've

tried to hide for oh so long

times come to ramble on

girl:

love, it hurts sometimes, it's kept me blind

from all the running 'round you do

cry, hell i cry sometimes

then i let jack and johnny take the place of you

repeat chorus

girl:

love, you've lost your mind

your always stoned and never home when i'm blue

and i'm blue, just like those eyes

cause your guitars the only girl who you'd

ever give your heart to
```
