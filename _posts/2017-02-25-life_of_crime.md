### A duet

Guy:  
Crime, it pays sometimes  
But nickles and dimes  
Dont get me very close to you  

Thats well and fine, I'll fry my mind  
All day long 'cause I ain't got shit else to do  

Chorus:  
And baby, there ain't no question  
If this is right or wrong  
The only question is for how far and how long  
I'll drag these heels of mine  
Through this dirt and shit that I've  
Tried to hide for oh so long  
Times come to ramble on  

Girl:  
Love, it hurts sometimes  
It's kept me blind  
From all the running 'round you do  

Cry, hell I cry sometimes  
Then I let Jack and Johnny take the place of you  

Repeat Chorus  

Girl:  
Love, you've lost your mind  
Your always stoned and never home when I'm blue  

And I'm blue, just like those eyes  
Cause your guitars the only girl who you'd  
Ever give your heart to
