author: Reppard Walker
chords: E, A, D, B9

guy:

E                                        A
crime, it pays sometimes but nickles and dimes
                          E
dont get me very close to you

thats well and fine, i'll fry my mind
         A                                   E
all damn day 'cause i ain't got shit else to do


chorus:
         A                       D
and baby, there ain't no question
                         E
if this is right or wrong
A                D                       E
the only question is for how far and how long

i'll drag these heels of mine

through this dirt and shit that i've
                        B9
tried to hide for oh so long
                     E
times come to ramble on


girl:

E                                      A
love, it hurts sometimes, it's kept me blind
                                E
from all the running 'round you do

cry, hell i cry sometimes
           A                                 E
then i let jack and johnny take the place of you

repeat chorus


girl:

E                                        A
love, you've lost your mind, your always stoned
                        E
and never home when i'm blue

and i'm blue, just like those eyes
           A
cause your guitars the only girl who you'd
E
ever give your heart to
```
