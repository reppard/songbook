title:  "Pass Me By"

### G, Em

Get me out of this heap again  
I gone and did it to my own best friend  
Lord knows he don't deserve  
What you gonna do?  
 
I'll head out west on a north bound train  
I had a bird, all she did was complain  
So I told her something about  
Our fire burning out  
  
I still ain't gave up on life  
I'm living just out of spite  
  
Lord, I swore it was my first offense  
Except that time I left my whole hand print  
Across Rosey's little face  
I plum tore up the place  
 
Didn't think that I was in the wrong  
I found some numbers on the girls cellphone  
But Lord, who's counting now?  
My baby's doing without  

I still ain't gave up on life  
I do this all out of spite  
 
I ain't gonna let my life pass me by  
Ain't gonna let nobody ever stand in my way  
Hold a glass up high to the perfect night  
And with if the Good Lord willing  
I just might get paid
