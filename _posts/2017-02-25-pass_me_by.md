title:  "pass me by"
author: Reppard Walker

G, Em

get me out of this heap again

i gone and did it to my own best friend

lord knows he don't deserve

what you gonna do?


i'll head out west on a north bound train

i had a bird, all she did was complain

so i told her something about

our fire burning out


i still ain't gave up on life

i'm living just out of spite


lord, i swore it was my first offense

except that time i left my whole hand print

across rosey's little face

i plum tore up the place


didn't think that i was in the wrong

i found some numbers on the girls cellphone

but lord, who's counting now?

my baby's doing without


i still ain't gave up on life

i do this all out of spite


i ain't gonna let my life pass me by

ain't gonna let nobody ever stand in my way

hold a glass up high to the perfect night

and with if the good lord willing

i just might get paid
```
