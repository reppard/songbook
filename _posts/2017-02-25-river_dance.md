title:  "River Dance"
---
My mammy always told me  
"Count your blessings dear"  
Since hell froze over  
It's got no one to fear  

Except Jesus sitting down  
In a rusty Barber Chair  
He only asks for just a trim  
No, He don't want to cut his hair  

And I pray, cause what would I do on my own?  

Just ten summers later  
We all found our own roads  
Took them down to the river  
And took off all our clothes  

Our river dance  
Went untelevized  
When your 10 lbs lighter  
You've got nothing to hide  

Then I sank and wept, thought what would I do on my own?  

When these burdensome times get to heavy to hold  
I ain't dumb, and I ain't blind  
I just can't do what I'm told to sometimes  
Your damned if you do and fucked if you don't  
When not a soul on board could stop rocking the boat  
It's all you can do to get her out of the smoke and not choke
