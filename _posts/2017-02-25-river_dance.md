author: Reppard Walker

intro: C, Am, Dm, G7

C                                   Am
my mammy always told me "count your blessings dear"
      Dm                       G7
since hell froze over it's got no one to fear
C                               Am
there's jesus sitting down in a barber chair
   Dm                            G7                       C
he only asks for just a trim, no he don't want to cut his hair

      Am   F                   G       C     Am F G G G G
and i pray cause what would i do on my own?


C                             Am
just ten summers later we all found our own roads
          Dm                         G7
took them down to the river and took off all our clothes
C                     Am
our river dance went untelevized
          Dm                        G7
when your 10 lbs lighter you've got nothing to hide

       C        Am      F             G        C     Am F G G G G
then i sank and thought "what would i do on my own?"

           C
when these burdensome times
       F        G
get to heavy to hold
             C
well i ain't dumb, and i ain't blind
       F                 G                 C
i just can't do what i'm told to sometimes
       F                 G                 C
i just can't do what i'm told to sometimes
       F                 G
i just can't do what i'm told...

C Am F G
no no no
