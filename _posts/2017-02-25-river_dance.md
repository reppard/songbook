intro: C, Am, Dm, G7

C                                   Am
My mammy always told me "Count your blessings dear"
      Dm                       G7
Since hell froze over it's got no one to fear
C                               Am
There's Jesus sitting down in a barber chair
   Dm                            G7                       C
He only asks for just a trim no, He don't want to cut his hair

      Am   F                   G       C     Am F G G G G
And I pray cause what would I do on my own?


C                             Am
Just ten summers later we all found our own roads
          Dm                         G7
Took them down to the river and took off all our clothes
C                     Am
Our river dance went untelevized
          Dm                        G7
When your 10 lbs lighter you've got nothing to hide

       C        Am      F             G        C     Am F G G G G
Then I sank and thought "what would I do on my own?"

           C
When these burdensome times
       F        G
Get to heavy to hold
             C
Well I ain't dumb, and I ain't blind
       F                 G                 C
I just can't do what I'm told to sometimes
       F                 G                 C
I just can't do what I'm told to sometimes
       F                 G
I just can't do what I'm told...

C Am F G
No no no
