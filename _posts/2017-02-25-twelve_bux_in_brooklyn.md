title:  "twelve bux in brooklyn"
author: Reppard Walker

your foots tapping on the boulavard

your dodging me and the speeding cars

everyone wants to be a star but me


my mother says i gotta be a man

i'm just a boy with two broken hands

everyones got their silly plans but me

oh not me


chorus:

i just sing out loud as you walk right on by

and i sure hope your doing well and your new coat fits fine

it's not sad, it's just too late to save me


whiskey brought the worst in me

so got damn drunk that i couldn't see

the beauty right in front of me was fading


i tried my best just to be a man

had some help from a real good friend

i ended up piss drunk again, i'm wasted

so wasted


repeat chorus
```
