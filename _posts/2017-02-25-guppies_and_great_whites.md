title:  "guppies and great whites"
author: Reppard Walker

hey fathers, your sons are ever on the hunt

and mothers, your daughters or crying

with their broken wombs, stumbling from bar rooms

to take a chance in the den of the lion


you've cried and you've wept but their secrets you have kept

for fear that you might be forsaken

but now it's much to late cause you're the ones they hate

you've been asleep, never to be awakened


morality is just a skin that we've since shed

the human heart no longer red, it's blacker than it's ever been

still we cannot see just whats become of use

so full of hatred and with lust. how we've become so poisonous


sure we have our fun, we play with loaded guns

no one ever taught us how to use them

we slowly take our aim at unsuspecting game

but their content to furage on illusions


our precious little prey gets braver everyday

swimming further from the shore line

plenty of fish there are, but theres just as many sharks

its hard to tell a guppy from a great white


will we all drink ourselves to sleep? or will we fuck ourselves to death?

i'm a liar and a theif. a hollow, broken shell is all that's left
