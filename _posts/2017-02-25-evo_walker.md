title:  "evo walker"
author: Reppard Walker

verse:

the ol walker boy was a site to see

after four whole years with no tv

he's steady now on his way back home

no more collect calls from the telephone


like a crow uncaged he was flying free

my birth given name was given back to me

no jack boots now, he's running from

all the shit that comes along with be dumb and young


bridge:

oh boy, if you only knew

all the troubles you've gotten me into

you'd put my name where it belongs

the ol man's been waiting on the phone to say

just to say


chorus:

he said "now son if you only knew.

you was a teenage boy when i last met you

and even though you don't look like me

hell, i named and i'll claim you

until the salt bleeds from the sea."


verse:

two years later walker's sitting pretty

done packed his shit to new york city

took a graveyard shift at a county morgue

but all the stiffs were such a bore


came home every night with a pocket of jewelery

he found a wedding band and then he sent it to me

they went and sent him right back to jail

he spends his weekends working on the work detail
```
