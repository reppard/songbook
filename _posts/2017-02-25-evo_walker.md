Verse:  
The ol Walker boy was a site to see  
After four whole years with no TV  
He's steady now on his way back home  
No more collect calls from the telephone  

Like a crow uncaged he was flying free  
My birth given name was given back to me  
No jack boots now, he's running from  
All the shit that comes along with be dumb and young  

Bridge:  
Oh boy, if you only knew  
All the troubles you've gotten me into  
You'd put my name where it belongs  
The ol man's been waiting on the phone to say  
Just to say  

Chorus:  
He said "Now son if you only knew.  
You was a teenage boy when I last met you  
And even though you don't look like me  
Hell, I named and I'll claim you  
Until the salt bleeds from the sea."  

Verse:  
Two years later Walker's sitting pretty  
Done packed his shit to New York City  
Took a graveyard shift at a county morgue  
But all the stiffs were such a bore  

Came home every night with a pocket of jewelery  
He found a wedding band and then he sent it to me  
They went and sent him right back to jail  
He spends his weekends working on the work detail
