title:  "Up and Out"
---
Here we've all got our own differences  
So have yours meet mine where the graveyard ends  
Don't whistle by so carelessly  
The breathless and I could use your company  
Maybe they ain't got much to say  
I'm screaming to myself here anyway  

Come on, you've gotta dig me up  
To catch my breath  
Somebody's gotta dig me out  
 
Now there ain't no ringing my bell  
They've severed my string, I'm to hoarse to yell  
I whisper my farewell to thee  
Cruel world good-bye, you've got the best of me  
Maybe I ain't got long to live  
Exhume me while I still have a hand to give  
Lord I want to live
