title:  "up and out"
author: Reppard Walker

here we've all got our own differences

so have yours meet mine where the graveyard ends

don't whistle by so carelessly

the breathless and i could use your company

maybe they ain't got much to say

i'm screaming to myself here anyway


come on, you've gotta dig me up

to catch my breath

somebody's gotta dig me out


now there ain't no ringing my bell

they've severed my string, i'm to hoarse to yell

i whisper my farewell to thee

cruel world good-bye, you've got the best of me

maybe i ain't got long to live

exhume me while i still have a hand to give

lord i want to live
```
