title:  "winter rose"
author: Reppard Walker

i wish things were different but i can't

unstrike a match that is slowly burning

holes inside my winter rose

this ain't how loves' meant to be


i know i can get cold and you shiver in the morning

but then i leave you alone


there's still time, we can't be ghosts tonight

no, we should celebrate the friends we've made


and sing from our hearts all our sorrow

we'll live like theres no tomorrow

there's only so much i can do to get to you

but oh, i'll try.  oh, i'll try


i can be so difficult when i get

my mind set on just what i want and

you can be so patient with me

that you don't even see


the demon in my soul still you took me and you made me whole

and then i left you alone


the plans we make, the smiles we fake

paint a bitter fate for you and me


to sing from our hearts all our sorrow

yeah we live like theres no tomorrow

i never meant to be this way

as hard as i try to get you back


i'd do anything to get you back

i'd do anything to get you back cause you bring me back

you bring me back to my center where i'm back on track

ain't life a riddle when you're all alone?
