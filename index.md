## Ain't That Funny
----------
Remember those good times?  You can't ignore
How I kept you laughing til your gut turned sore
Now you sit silent as I head for the door
I guess I just ain't that damn funny no more

Our share of bad times
Could stack to the roof
And if all these holes
In these walls ain't proof
Sheet rock on my knuckles
And glass on the floor
I guess I just ain't that damn funny no more

Use to we'd fight
But we'd make up all right
We'd be back to loving
By the end of the night
You'd call me a dick
And I'd call you a whore
I guess I just ain't that damn funny no more

## All Damn Night
----------
We'll take a trip where souls eclipse us
We wont need a boarding pass
If true love is what you're out to get
It isn't love if you've gotta ask

I know just what you've been waiting for
Something pure and spiritual

We'll dance just like you wanted to
How about on the couch?
Move it to the floor
We've got all damn night and tomorrow too
We'll hit every room
'til our knees get sore
Oh I swear you move like light
Lets just take our time
Cause we've got all damn night

You can't run from your addictions
An instinct makes sure of that
Carnal pulse dictates your actions
Don't you find it funny that

Those night lights get your paranoid
When the rhythm stops you feel a void
I know just what you've been waiting for
Something pure and spiritual

## American Plight
----------
Verse:
Summer came back to life
Born out of dying Spring
The setting Sun was on the run
And sank into the sea

It barely made a splash
So far as anyone could see
And held it's breath one-thousand years
Waiting to be let free

But it lost... the fight... with the tide

Verse:
Then Winter came to shake our hands
Like long forgotten friends
His crooked smile
All frozen on the outside looking in

The crocodile swallowed the child
Just as his life had began
His toothy smile
A faded yellow army of crimson

And we've all... lost sight... of the Light

Chorus:
Now I don't think I'll
Be winning the fight
This new American pride
This new American plight

Now I think it's time
We bury the knife
This new America

## Damn Sam
----------
Damn Sam, you ain't no ma'am Sam
You ain't no woman as I recall

But in your red gown, you let your hair down
Another round and it gets hard to call

I'll believe anything you want
Any thing you want at all
Just so long as this old room
Gets some use before the wakeup call at none

Damn Sam, I let you down.  It's not all me
I'm backed against the wall

My wife found your wigs and gold crown
Whiskey and coke mounds, we sure had a ball didn't we?

She'll believe anything I want
Anything I want at all
Just so long as you and I
Keep this hid though this love is so hard to hide

## Evo Walker
----------
Verse:
The ol Walker boy was a site to see
After four whole years with no TV
He's steady now on his way back home
No more collect calls from the telephone

Like a crow uncaged he was flying free
My birth given name was given back to me
No jack boots now, he's running from
All the shit that comes along with be dumb and young

Bridge:
Oh boy, if you only knew
All the troubles you've gotten me into
You'd put my name where it belongs
The ol man's been waiting on the phone to say
Just to say

Chorus:
He said "Now son if you only knew.
You was a teenage boy when I last met you
And even though you don't look like me
Hell, I named and I'll claim you
Until the salt bleeds from the sea."

Verse:
Two years later Walker's sitting pretty
Done packed his shit to New York City
Took a graveyard shift at a county morgue
But all the stiffs were such a bore

Came home every night with a pocket of jewelery
He found a wedding band and then he sent it to me
They went and sent him right back to jail
He spends his weekends working on the work detail

## Firefly
----------
G, Am, D, C, G

I met at little blue eyed firefly
From Alabam
Bare foot as a grizzly bear
Drinking warm sweet tea
In her underwear

On the back porch
Her camel lights
Were all in line
To kiss the lips
That keep on calling mine

An angel raised on honky tonk
Thats what she claims to be
But those precious little shoulder blades
They don't look like wings to me

I don't think those pretty eyes
Have seen the harder side
Of heart ache they call honky tonk, no

## Gabby Tongue
----------
Today I found a ghost
dress in my old clothes
he was whistling
something tongue in cheek

And he wouldn't listen
when I tried to speak
I swear I saw him glance
over his whiskey drink

Thats when I felt the chill
like some frozen air
all his demons still
my own cross to bare

And I was terrified
so I ran away
to save these similes
for a rainy day

My hearts just an anchor
hung here to weigh me down
my souls is a beggar
roaming town to town to town to town
my mind is a twister
disordered anarchy
my life's a cautious clown...
playing tricks on me.

see theres no subtlety
in false bravery
I bravely lock the door
and discard the key

stained glass shattering
down around my feet
symbolic christening
on an abstract street

see I am now 32
could be a lot like you
still got no answers for
all the things I do

I am an animal
acting on instinct
like the callous sheep
who counts himself to sleep

## I'm Losing My Mind
----------
D, Bm, G, A

People say that I'm losing my mind
But I know it ain't me
This old damn world is just spinning to slow

Yeah, I think I'm doing fine
If Mona could see me
She'd probably turn up her nose

No she wont listen to me
Why does her memory rot in my soul?
The darkness don't listen to me
If I had half a mind
I'd probably blow it away

I think I done lost my mind
Somewhere between here
And mushrooms down in Strawberry Grove

To get it back it just might take a little time
Some big laughing bird
Just flew by, snatched it right out my nose

Now his madness consumes me
Why does his song sing in my soul?
The darkness don't listen to me
I use to have a mind
But then I blew it away

I think I done lost my mind

## Life of Crime *(A duet)*
----------
Guy:
Crime, it pays sometimes
But nickles and dimes
Dont get me very close to you

Thats well and fine, I'll fry my mind
All day long 'cause I ain't got shit else to do

Chorus:
And baby, there ain't no question
If this is right or wrong
The only question is for how far and how long
I'll drag these heels of mine
Through this dirt and shit that I've
Tried to hide for oh so long
Times come to ramble on

Girl:
Love, it hurts sometimes
It's kept me blind
From all the running 'round you do

Cry, hell I cry sometimes
Then I let Jack and Johnny take the place of you

Repeat Chorus

Girl:
Love, you've lost your mind
Your always stoned and never home when I'm blue

And I'm blue, just like those eyes
Cause your guitars the only girl who you'd
Ever give your heart to

## Lost In a Hollow
----------
I searched a valley for a peaceful spring
The grass was green and all the birds were singing
For a moment so brief I thought that I could breath
And I got caught up in the moment
Like a river I was running free
The taste of life was what I really wanted

Well I searched all day and oh what did I find?
When the sun burns out, oh how it makes you blind
Shadows made nightmares from my day dreams
Creatures prepared to seize the moment
The wolves could smell me, they could hear me breath
To taste my life was what they really wanted

When I get lost in a hollow
The way out ain't always so easy to find
It's always cold sweats and regrets that follow
When I get lost in a hollow

The dawn came on just like a rolling tide
And my brain in pain told me I hadn't died
I stood myself up to dust off my blue jeans
Filthy to clean in just a moment
A rocky path had crawled beneath my feet
To lead me where I really wanted

## Pass Me By
----------
G, Em

Get me out of this heap again
I gone and did it to my own best friend
Lord knows he don't deserve
What you gonna do?

I'll head out west on a north bound train
I had a bird, all she did was complain
So I told her something about
Our fire burning out

I still ain't gave up on life
I'm living just out of spite

Lord, I swore it was my first offense
Except that time I left my whole hand print
Across Rosey's little face
I plum tore up the place

Didn't think that I was in the wrong
I found some numbers on the girls cellphone
But Lord, who's counting now?
My baby's doing without

I still ain't gave up on life
I do this all out of spite

I ain't gonna let my life pass me by
Ain't gonna let nobody ever stand in my way
Hold a glass up high to the perfect night
And with if the Good Lord willing
I just might get paid

## River Dance
----------

My mammy always told me
"Count your blessings dear"
Since hell froze over
It's got no one to fear

Except Jesus sitting down
In a rusty Barber Chair
He only asks for just a trim
No, He don't want to cut his hair

And I pray, cause what would I do on my own?

Just ten summers later
We all found our own roads
Took them down to the river
And took off all our clothes

Our river dance
Went untelevized
When your 10 lbs lighter
You've got nothing to hide

Then I sank and wept, thought what would I do on my own?

When these burdensome times get to heavy to hold
I ain't dumb, and I ain't blind
I just can't do what I'm told to sometimes
Your damned if you do and fucked if you don't
When not a soul on board could stop rocking the boat
It's all you can do to get her out of the smoke and not choke

## Sweep Me Up
----------
E, Bm7, A

Early Monday morning
I told my love
"Every time I fall to pieces
You're right there to sweep me up"

But pretty eyes
Can only get you by Love
Beauty fades out long before
Your words could ever die

When I fall down
You pick me up
Back on my feet where I belong
When I fall down
You pick me up
You dust me off and keep my fighting on

Sweeter than pure sugar cane
Is my Love
These rotten teeth may fall to pieces
But I could never spit her out

Pure cocaine can't hold a flame
To my Love
Gets the blood in my heart racing
Faster than a train run wild

## Unholy Smoke
----------
A7, D, Bm, Em

Unholy smoke on sacred ground
Fire consumes me without a sound
And I don't scream, I just stand around
Waiting to turn into ash and float into the sunset

Unholy smoke on sacred ground
A fire burns as dreams are turned to emptiness
Just like promises

We count the stars every night
But their numbers fade with the coming of the morning light
And thats alright, ain't it?

I'm not known for making promises
Cause I could not afford to keep them
But I would die for you...

Holy smoke on sacred ground
Fire consumes us without a sound
And we all just laugh and dance around
Waiting to turn into ash and float into the sunset

I lost hope
And I can't find
Her nowhere

## Up and Out
----------

Here we've all got our own differences
So have yours meet mine where the graveyard ends
Don't whistle by so carelessly
The breathless and I could use your company
Maybe they ain't got much to say
I'm screaming to myself here anyway

Come on, you've gotta dig me up
To catch my breath
Somebody's gotta dig me out

Now there ain't no ringing my bell
They've severed my string, I'm to hoarse to yell
I whisper my farewell to thee
Cruel world good-bye, you've got the best of me
Maybe I ain't got long to live
Exhume me while I still have a hand to give
Lord I want to live
